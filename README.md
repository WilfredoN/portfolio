# React + TypeScript + Vite made portfolio

### To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WilfredoN/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Plan 2.0

- [x] supabase integration
- [x] feedback api
- [x] FSD-like architecture
- [x] pnpm migration
- [x] github actions
- [ ] make supabase-independent feedback fetch (from exported json)
- [ ] realize fetch with React-Query (TanStack)
- [ ] git hooks (as husky alternative)
- [ ] jest unit tests
- [ ] next.js
